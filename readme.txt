When someone uses a web proxy to browse your website or blog, Proxy B Movement informs the visitor to get another proxy i.e. Hepatitis B vaccination.

== Description ==

**Why**

Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV). It is a major global health problem and the most serious type of viral hepatitis. 
As per global statistics, India has the second highest number of Hepatitis B infected (40+ million, second only to China), and most people with chronic Hepatitis B are unaware of their infection, putting them at serious risk of developing cirrhosis or liver cancer which are life threatening. 
While most of us worry about contracting HIV/AIDS, in reality, Hepatitis B is 100 times more contagious than HIV. 
A vaccine is available for Hepatitis B that helps one guard against the disease but people are largely unaware of it.

**How**

Hepatitis B mainly spreads by sexual contact.
Indians are among the most prolific consumers of internet pornography in the world. While Indian authorities keep blocking pornography (and non-pornography) websites, netizens always find a way out by using a proxy site to access the blocked websites. Proxy sites are also handy for employees to browse blocked social networking sites and blogs in corporate offices. 
Need of the hour is a proxy war against Hepatitis B to spread awareness about the vaccination.

**What**

Once this plugin is installed, your website joins the Proxy B movement to promote Hepatitis B awareness. Next time someone uses a web proxy to browse your website, the visitor is informed that one proxy is not enough, life demands many, asking him to get another proxy i.e. Hepatitis B vaccination. Prevention is better than cure.

Join the Proxy B Movement to promote Hepatitis B awareness. Visit: [www.proxyb.org](http://www.proxyb.org/)
Donâ€™t forget to ask your doctor for Hepatitis B screening and vaccination.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Is it safe to add this code to my blog/ website? =

Of course. As safe as the Hepatitis B vaccine. This code works only when someone is accessing your blog/ website through a web proxy, and the message is displayed only once. So, it's not annoying at all.

= Coding is all greek for me. Still, if you can help me understand how it works? =

It's pretty simple. All it does is check if the domain name of the blog/ website being visited matches to the actual domain or not. A negative means current visitor is accessing the blog/ website using a web proxy, and it passes a message to the visitor that he needs one more proxy i.e. Hepatitis B vaccination. When the user clicks ok to know more, it leads him to google search results. Using cookies, the code achieves displaying the message to the user only once.

= I don't have a blog/ website. How can I help? =

Above all, help yourself. Get tested and vaccinated for Hepatitis B. Now, if you are a blogger/ webmaster, you can help us by adding the code on your site. If you don't have a blog, still you can help spread the words by sharing this movement with your friends. You tell your friends. They tell their friends. Soon, it becomes a movement. Also, we plan to come up with simple one-click-install plugins for more blogging platforms. If you are a developer and willing to volunteer, please contact at rupeshmandal@gmail.com

= I have my doubts about how effective it is to promote Hepatitis B awareness? =

It's just the beginning. The frequency by which Indian authorities are blocking freedom of speech, imagine if all the websites/ blogs have the code added. Moreover, due to company policies many websites and blogs, especially with adult content are blocked in offices by firewall. In that case too, this code promotes awareness about Hepatitis B when an employee bypasses company policies using a proxy; given the site being part of this movement.

3. Proxy B Movement, once installed, alerts your website visitors to get vaccinated for Hepatitis B if they access your site via a web proxy.
